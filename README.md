# XLEngine

## TODO
* game plugin fix-ups

## Dependencies
* DevIL Cross-platform image loading and manipulation toolkit
* enet Thin network communication layer on top of UDP
* GLEW OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
* SDL2 Cross-platform low-level I/O access
* cmake

### Install the dependencies on Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install libdevil-dev libenet-dev libglew-dev libsdl2-dev
```

### Install the dependencies on Windows with [vcpkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/vcpkg):
```bash
vcpkg install devil enet glew sdl2
```

## Building
We use CMake as the cross-platform build system.

### Building on Linux:
```bash
git checkout https://github.com/Mindwerks/XLEngine.git
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../XLEngine; make -j4
```

### Building on Windows:
(Replace ```< Location of vcpkg >``` with the location where you installed vcpkg)
```bash
git checkout https://github.com/Mindwerks/XLEngine.git
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=< Location of vcpkg >\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake ../XLEngine
```

## Runtime Configuration
Game data paths and render settings are specified in XLEngine.conf. On non-
Windows systems, it will look for this in the XDG standard directory:
```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/XLEngine/XLEngine.conf
```
or, if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset or empty:
```
$HOME/.config/XLEngine/XLEngine.conf
```

On all systems, it will then search for XLEngine.conf in the process's working
directory and use the settings there as overrides.

The available settings are:
```
[general]
width = # window/screen width, 320 minimum
height = # window/screen height, 200 minimum
fullscreen = # true or false
vsync = # true or false
emulate-low-res = # true to render at 320x200 and stretch to fit, or false
renderer = # opengl, soft32 (true-color software), soft8 (paletted software)

[DaggerXL]
data-path = # Full path to game data, e.g. C:\DAGGER\ARENA2

[DarkXL]
data-path = # ...

[BloodXL]
data-path = # ...

[OutlawsXL]
data-path = # ...
```

Currently the game must be run from where it can find the DarkXL/, DaggerXL/,
etc. directories, where the AngelScript (\*.as) and image (\*.png) files are for
the respective games. Just copy the contents of the resources/ directory to your build directory.
